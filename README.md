# UFO-Gravity-Game
It's a 2D game made with Unity2D with assets from the Unity asset store.

It is basically a 2D UFO.

It has a scrollable background.

Avoid lasers.

Collect coins.

You have 3 buttons.

'D' for Forward, 'A' for Backwards and 'SPACE' to change the gravity of the UFO.

Implements a rather simple logic, with 3 levels with random number of coin packs to collect and lasers to avoid.

It was a project made for a lesson in the MSc I was participating at the time.
